    <p class="post-text">Nvidia and AMD are gearing up to launch gaming laptops that include the AI Copilot Plus features 
        that Microsoft just announced for Qualcomm-powered laptops. At Computex today, Nvidia briefly teased that 
        “RTX AI PC” laptops are on the way from Asus and MSI that will eventually include Copilot Plus PC features.
        “These Windows 11 AI PCs will receive a free update to Copilot+ PC experiences when available,” says Nvidia 
        in a blog post. That suggests that Microsoft might not be ready to launch Recall and the other AI-powered
         Windows features on AMD chips, or that there could be some period of exclusivity for the Windows on Arm 
         Qualcomm-powered hardware that launches on June 18th. Either way, we’ve reached out to Nvidia to clarify 
         what its brief mention of this free update means. Nvidia is also collaborating with Microsoft on the 
         underlying AI models that are being built into Windows 11. “The collaboration will provide application
          developers with easy application programming interface (API) access to GPU-accelerated small language 
          models (SLMs) that enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities that run on-device powered 
          by Windows Copilot Runtime,” says Nvidia. Microsoft’s Windows Copilot Runtime is designed to make it 
          easy for developers to add AI-powered features to their apps, all while relying on NPU hardware to 
          accelerate those features, or GPUs from Nvidia soon.While these AI-enhanced laptops will initially 
          launch without Copilot Plus features, a free update will eventually bring Microsoft’s AI capabilities
           to these devices. This strategic move aligns with Nvidia’s efforts to ensure its GPUs remain pivotal
            for AI tasks, emphasizing their superior capacity for handling complex AI workloads compared to NPUs.
             Nvidia is also launching an RTX AI Toolkit in June to optimize and deploy AI models efficiently, 
             further solidifying its collaboration with Microsoft in advancing AI-powered computing.
