    <p class="post-text">The iPhone 16 will bring notable changes to the iPhone lineup, with Apple expected to increase
        the size of the iPhone 16 Pro to 6.3 inches
        and the size of the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 6.9 inches, marking the first size upgrade in several years. 
        When the iPhone 16 arrives this fall, it's not going to look that different from the iPhone models that came before it. 
        That's the nature of smartphones these days where unless you're showing off a new foldable design — 
        and we're not expecting an iPhone Flip until 2027 — phones don't change all that radically from year to year.
        the Action button on the iPhone 16 will work much the same as it has on the current Pro models. 
        A long press silences calls, recreating the Mute switch's function, with the phone vibrating to let 
        you know the sound is muted. But from the Settings app, you can also set the Action button to trigger a particular shortcut, 
        whether it's launching an app, turning on the flashlight, starting the voice recorder or performing a specific action within certain apps.
         You can even tie the Action button to a series of actions you've put together with the built-in Shortcuts app.
         There's more than just aesthetic reasons for this redesign. When you record spatial video, 
         you're capturing footage with both the main and ultrawide cameras simultaneously so the final videos have
          the immersive depth required. That's easier to do with vertically stacked lenses, so consider this move motivated 
         by Apple's desire to have more people capturing spatial video to be viewed on the Apple Vision Pro headset.
         Ming-Chi Kuo claimed that the iPhone 16 Pro would be getting a slightly larger display to accommodate a new periscope camera,
          as seen on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. A few weeks earlier, on 9 May 2023, Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants claimed 
          that the aspect ratio of the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max would be increasing in size to 6.3in and 6.9in, giving users bigger 
          displays and (inevitably) bigger batteries.
