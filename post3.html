    <p class="post-text">Microsoft announced a major update for Fabric, its unified platform for end-to-end data analytics.
        The company said the platform will now have a new workload called Real-Time Intelligence,
         enabling enterprises to ingest, analyze and take actions on real-time data streams. At its Build 2024 conference, 
         Microsoft announced a major update for Fabric, its unified platform for end-to-end data analytics. 
         The company said the platform will now have a new work
         load called Real-Time Intelligence, enabling enterprises to ingest, analyze and take actions on 
         real-time data streams. While the capability is still in preview, it will enable enterprises to do 
         much more across their data estate, be it informing team leads about idling equipment or reporting 
         a failure on the payment page. According to Arun Ulagaratchagan, corporate vice president for Azure 
         Data at Microsoft, the capability can provide teams with “up-to-the-minute” insights, improving their 
         decision-making in the fast-paced business environment. When Microsoft launched Fabric last year, 
         the goal was to provide a unified place where teams could combine all their data and tools to get 
         insights more seamlessly and efficiently. In addition to real-time intelligence, Microsoft is 
         launching a Fabric workload development kit in preview. The offering will allow developers to 
         create and launch applications as native workloads within the unified platform. Over the coming 
         months, the company will launch a workload hub to help developers discover, add and manage these 
         custom workloads — without leaving the Fabric environment.
